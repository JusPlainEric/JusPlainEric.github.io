        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p style="font-size:17px">My name is Eric Rodriguez and I'm a graduate of University of California, Irvine.
          I graduated as a Computer Engineer in June 2020.<br /><br />


          While learning at UCI, I've worked on several projects both in and outside of class.
          From online chat programs with a custom GUI to a gallery website that used Python, HTML/CSS, and MySQL, I have
          created a wide variety of programs and applications.
          My most notable projects are my capstone project (the Autonomous Target Scoring Drone) and my research with
          Professor Glenn Healey (Raspberry Pi Image Recognition).
          My most comfortable languages are Python, C and C++. However, I also have experience with HTML/CSS, MySQL,
          Java, and some assembly languages.<br /><br />

          Currently I am working on developing these websites and learning how to 3D model to make better prints with my
          3D printer. <br />
          I am also working on a bluetooth controlled RC car in addition to working with RGB lighting both controlled
          via microcontroller.<br /><br />

          I hope to gain more experience through work that I would not be able to get at school. The infrastructure of a
          large company and the timeline for projects is much different compared to classes.
          I've worked on both team projects and solo projects, but never on a large scaled product. I wish to expand on
          what I learned in school and apply all the concepts I learned in the workforce.
